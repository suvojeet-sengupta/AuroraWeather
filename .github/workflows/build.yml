#
# 🚀 Enhanced Flutter Build, Release, and Notify Workflow with Auto-Commit 🚀
#
# What's new and improved?
# 1.  **AUTOMATIC COMMIT ✨**: The workflow now automatically commits the NDK version fix to your repository. This runs only once and keeps your codebase clean.
# 2.  **Semantic Versioning**: Reads the version directly from your `pubspec.yaml` file.
# 3.  **Dedicated Actions**: Uses specialized GitHub Actions for cleaner, more reliable code.
# 4.  **Enhanced Security**: Fetches secrets securely using `secrets.VARIABLE_NAME`.
